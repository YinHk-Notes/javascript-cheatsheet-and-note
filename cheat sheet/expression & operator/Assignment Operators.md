| Shorthand | Expression | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a +=b | a = a + b | Adds 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first. |
| a -= b | a = a - b | Subtracts 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first. |
| a *= b | a = a*b | Multiplies 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first. |
| a /=b | a = a/b | Divides 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first. |
| a %= b | a = a%b | Computes the modulus of 2 numbers and assigns the result to the first. |
| a<<=b | a = a<<b | Performs a left shift and assigns the result to the first operand. |
| a>>=b | a = a>>b | Performs a sign-propagating right shift and assigns the result to the first operand. |
| a>>>=b | a = a>>>b | Performs a zero-fill right shift and assigns the result to the first operand. |
| a&= b | a = a&b | Performs a bitwise AND and assigns the result to the first operand. |
| a^= b | a = a^b | Performs a bitwise XOR and assigns the result to the first operand. |
