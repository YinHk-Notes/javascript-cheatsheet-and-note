/* Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order
   It likes an array, but cannot has duplicated value. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique 
   in the Set's collection. Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references */
